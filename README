Hi.

I originally wanted to make an `ls` clone that requires a 4GB Docker container
to run, just like the industry standard. But I got tired and accidentally
wrote it in 69 lines of C instead.

I am deeply sorry for the fast execution times. I will try to add
more lag in the next version.

If you know how to make these files bigger without actually adding any value,
please PR. I'm trying to get the file size of `true` up to at least
10 megabytes so people take me seriously as a developer.

Enjoy.
